                <p>Dear Ms. Smith,</p>
                
                <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer position at TechCorp. With over 10 years of experience in developing scalable web applications and leading engineering teams, I am confident I would be a valuable addition to your organization.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout my career, I have focused on building robust, maintainable systems that solve real business problems. At my current role, I successfully led the migration of our monolithic application to a microservices architecture, resulting in a 40% improvement in system performance and significantly reduced deployment times.</p>
                
                <p>I am particularly drawn to TechCorp's mission of making technology accessible to everyone. Your recent work on AI-powered accessibility tools aligns perfectly with my passion for creating inclusive software solutions.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience could contribute to TechCorp's continued success.</p>
                
                <p>Best regards,<br>John Doe</p>
